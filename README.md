# Bootstrap 3 kick-starter

Nice way to kick-start new bootstrap-3 based template. Just `npm install`, `grunt develop`. Less files are in `less` folder, HTML template is in the `www` folder. HTTP server is started at http://localhost:8080/ by default.

Templates are compiled from .jade - this allows you to avoid all kind of repetitions (e.g. header/footer/layout, repeating blocks). You can edit jade-data.json to add some variables for the jade tempaltes.

Optionally you may place design image at www/img/main_page.png and start coding on the top of it. Default opacity is 0.2, but you can vary that e.g. in browser debug console.

## Features included

 * http-server for serving static files from www folder
 * livereload (browser extension required)
 * less files are automatically compiled to css
 * jade templates

## TODO

You need to re-check versions of dependencies listed in package.json from time to time. They might be outdated.
